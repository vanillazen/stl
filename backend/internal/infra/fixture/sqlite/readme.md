# Fixture Package

The Fixture Package provides a temporary mechanism to pre-populate the database with sample data. It is designed to quickly set up a database with initial data for testing or development purposes. However, it should be noted that this package is not intended for production use and will be improved to make it more suitable for application use cases.
